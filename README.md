## WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
It is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

## MACHINE LEARNING CATHEGORIES? 

#### Supervised
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Regression 
* Logistic Regression 
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
* Decision Trees and Random Forests • Neural network
#### unsupervised
* Clustering
  * K-Means
  * DBSCAN
  * Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
*  Anomaly detection and novelty detection
  * One-class SVM
  * Isolation Forest
* Visualization and dimensionality reduction
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Kernel PCA —Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
  * t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
* Association rule learning
  * Apriori
  * Eclat
#### semisupervised

Algorithms that can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data. Google photos is a great example (photo recognition and labeling)

#### Reinforcement Learning

An agent can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards).  
It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.
For example, it is used on robots so they learn how to walk. 

#### online vs batch learning
#### instance based vs model-based learning

## DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

Simplify the data without losing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one

## FEATURE EXTRACTION

For example, a car’s mileage may be very correlated with its age, so the dimensionality reduction algorithm will merge them into one feature that represents the car’s wear and tea

## ANOMALY DETECTION

Identifying data points in data that don't fit the normal patterns. For example, detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects, or automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm

## NOVELTY DETECTION

Statistical method used to determine new or unknown data and determining if these new data are within the norm (inlier) or outside of it (outlier).

## ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING

The goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes.
